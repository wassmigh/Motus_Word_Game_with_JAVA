# Motus_Word_Game_with_JAVA
 A text-based word-guessing game inspired by classic puzzles. Players attempt to guess a hidden word within a limited number of tries. The project features a configurable dictionary and tracks game statistics, offering both a "configuration mode" for word management and a "game mode" for playing.
